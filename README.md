### Alexander Ahlgreen Madsen
I'm a Danish full-stack web developer with experience in React, Node and anything in between. I mainly specialize in web development, but I also enjoy developing C++ applications. Graduated as a Web Developer from Roskilde Technical College in Denmark.

I am a member of [Rupitian](https://github.com/Rupitian/), a small team of programmers, where I help develop [Diannex](https://github.com/Rupitian/diannex) and its various interpreters.

I have knowledge in many areas of web development, and even some outside of web development. Here are just some of the things I have worked with:
- C++ game engine development
- Full-stack web development with React, Node, and NextJS.
- REST API development with Express, MongoDB, and MySQL.
