### Alexander Ahlgreen Madsen
I'm a Danish full-stack web developer with experience in React, Node and anything in between. I mainly specialize in web development, but I also enjoy developing C++ applications. I've been writing code since I was 10 years old and I'm still going strong. Feel free to send challenges my way.

I have knowledge in many areas of web development. Here are just some of the things I have knowledge of:
- Basic logical concepts of programming
- Client-side development (Modern HTML/CSS/JavaScript, ReactJS, EJS)
- Server-side JavaScript (Node.js)
- REST API development and use (Express, HTTP/HTTPS, MySQL)
- Progressive Web Apps
